# Workflow Rules

1. **Issue-First Development**: Always ensure there is a GitHub Issue for the task at hand before writing code.
   - If an issue exists, reference it.
   - If not, create one using `gh issue create`.
2. **Pull Requests**: All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request linked to the issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Never push directly to `main`.
   - Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/my-feature` or `fix/issue-123`).
